Module CellArrays

Provides support for an AbstractArray subtype `CellArray`, which represents arrays with cells that can contain logical arrays instead of single values; the data is stored in an optimal fashion for GPU HPC applications.

# General overview and examples
https://github.com/omlins/CellArray.jl

# Constructors and type aliases
- [`CellArray`](@ref)
- [`CPUCellArray`](@ref)
- `CuCellArray` (available via [`@define_CuCellArray`](@ref))
- `ROCCellArray` (available via [`@define_ROCCellArray`](@ref))
- `MtlCellArray` (available via [`@define_MtlCellArray`](@ref))

# Functions (additional to standard AbstractArray functionality)
- [`cellsize`](@ref)
- [`blocklength`](@ref)

To see a description of a constructor or function type `?<constructorname>` or `?<functionname>`, respectively.

!!! note "Performance note"
    If a CellArray's cells contain more than what fits into registers, the performance on Nvidia GPUs will deviate from the optimal, if access is not performed by accessing the cells' values individually to reduce register pressure.
